# Heartrate-monitoring


**ABSTRACT**



This paper describes real-life applications for getting the heart rate of a person by getting the Beats Per Minute (BPM), ECG (electrocardiogram), and IBI (Inter-Beat Interval) of the person using Arduino. The Heart Rate Pulse Sensor Module, a key sensor, is included in the model. The changes in heart rate are monitored by the heart rate pulse sensor module. It keeps track of the BPM as the beats per minute. The heart rate sensor also depicts the person's ECG and IBI. The interval between heart beats is used to calculate the IBI. The heart pulse sensor modules are secured to the Arduino uno board and are analyzed by the Arduino IDE. The pulse sensor module measures the heart rate and outputs it to the serial plotter and processing development environment, which creates 2D drawings of the heart rate graphics. In order to obtain an accurate 500Hz pulse sensor signal and a high-quality BPM readout, Arduino employs a hardware time interrupt. The serial baud rate is set to 
115200 to get a clear graph.

**Introduction**



As we can see, nowadays, about a thousand individuals pass away each month as a result of neglecting their health owing to excessive workloads. The Internet of Things is something we have decided to incorporate. We all know that IOT makes life easier, and our initiative will use it to benefit everyone.  
Because of its cutting-edge technology, heart rate monitoring systems are one of the significant advancements in the worldwide healthcare program. Due to the high rate of heart attack deaths among hospitalized ill patients, this technological innovation is desperately needed. Heart disease, including heart attacks, coronary disease, congestive heart failure, and congenital heart disease, is the leading cause of death for both men and women globally.  
This work provides the potential for continuous heart rate monitoring for persons who live alone and have no one to check on their condition. It was created to provide patients with prompt and appropriate heart health.
